What metric matters when measuring slow?

100ms -> Instantaneous
1000ms -> maintains stream of thought
10s -> lost the user completely

Four phases of user experience
1) Loading
2) Response
3) Scrolling/Animation (60fps)
4) Idle (user expects that it will be ready when it decides to start interacting with the page)

RAIL performance model (Response Animation Idle Loading)

R - Tap to paint < 100ms, touchmove to paint < 16ms
A - 60fps (<16ms)
I - main thread js work completes in 50ms chunks
L - ready to use in 1000ms, satisfy the response goals during full load

New chrome dev tools for measuring performance better coming soon

you can't guess what code is faster. Test it.

position:absolute makes rendering faster for items that need to be moved in animations.

translation & alpha are super fast.

scaling is expensive... composite instead

Video not animated gifs <- bad for browser memory usage

strokes are slow also

*this talk is a good one for Blaine to see

The UI layer is the experimentation layer

SharedWorkers for threading with shared memory... but the next line is better

SharedArrayBuffer is coming for sharing contents of a buffer between a set of workers. <= rad

SharedArrayBuffer is now in Firefox and almost in Chrome

very high quantity of very high quality examples to help with an order of magnitude jump. 300-400 in a compressed time frame gets people there.

This helps the brain move beyond the simple surface details.
