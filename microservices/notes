MSA = decentralized service development (YES!!!)

MSA = DevOPS + SOA

Self Contained service with a "single job to be done"

deploy 50 times per day... 25 to prod.

http service boundaries make things easy because of the existing tools out there.

treat network down as the base state of the network. Isolate your breakage.

Reduce cognitive overhead.
Uniform Interfaces!!!

3 major challenges:
1) Creating a service
	Lots of effort to create a service from scratch. They created a python library that allows you to build a rest service really quickly
		Builtin health check/heartbeat endpoint
		common logging and metrics frameworks
		simple dependency management.

	Best language for the job folks. Best languages for the job.
2) Language Agnostic
	http, rest, syslog and statsd.

	service discovery to find the correct service without knowing the server name in code.

	Look at HAproxy these guys are doing some amazing stuff with service discovery

	github.com/runscope has their healthcheck software...

If you are sharing things (code) then you might want to break down your service to something smaller. Sharing is a service.

 Aggregation layers. wurd.
