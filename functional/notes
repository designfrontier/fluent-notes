Cooking and functional programming... 

We often add unneeded things for histroical reasons making our code much more complex then it needs to be

optimizing for developer time... <= this is important. We talk about other types of performance too much

currying:
turning a function with n arguments into n functions with 1 argument

combinatory logic <= read about this

point free style <= also read about this

events and functional programming... hmmm... interesting idea

Monads:
can chain things into sequences when sequence is important
